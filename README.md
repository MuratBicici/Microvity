Hello that's me Murat!
I had the opportunity to participate in the NASA Space Apps Challenge, held at Gebze Technical University on October 5-6. During this exciting 36-hour Hackathon, our team worked on the challenge titled "Galactic Games: Fun in Microgravity."

Together with my team, we designed a game that leverages the unique challenges and opportunities of microgravity to help astronauts unwind during their long missions. The game, with its music and atmosphere, aims to provide a short, relaxing experience beneficial for their psychological well-being.

We developed most of the project using the Godot game engine, incorporating physical controls via Arduino and joystick. For the music production, we used FL-Studio. Our programming languages were GD-script and Python.

I would like to thank all my teammates who worked with me on this project.
